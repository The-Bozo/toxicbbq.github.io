Another Toxic in the books. Our 8th and the 18th overall.

*2024 Stats:*
800 hackers
700 burgers
500 hot dogs
50 non-meat patties
50 cases of bottled water
and countless conversations over smoked salmon, pork shoulder, homebrew, mead, and cheeses

Thanks to your generosity,  we covered costs and raised over $1000 for the [EFF](https://www.eff.org). Uncounted is the time volunteers spent grilling, prepping, and cleaning up. We can’t wait to meat you all next year.

Also check out the [Gallery](/gallery) for shots from Photo Goon AJ702 and others.

*Here’s the rest of the invite page for posterity:*

The humans of Vegas invite you to this year’s unofficial welcome party. Join us off-Strip in the shade of Sunset Park for a heat-blasted hangout. Burgers, dogs, and meatless options are provided. Attendees pitch in to make everything else happen.

Contribute more food and drinks, staff the grill, join supply runs, or donate cash to help cover costs. Relax under the trees and conversate with new and old friends. Come be a part of what makes this cookout something to remember year after year.

## Events
In addition to the grill, Toxic is a gathering place for hackers looking to plan the rest of their weekend. Start your carnival off right with these side-shows:

- Peppercon: Push your spice tolerance to its breaking point. 
- Homebrew Exhibition: Bring your finest bitters, ciders, wine, and assorted preparations for a fermented face off.
- Weird Jerky: You can buy anything in Vegas, like dehydrated meat of questionable taste and origin. Spin the Wheel. Will it be ostrich, earthworm, or something even better?
- Open Grill: Bring your favorite and most exotic cuts, then grill it just how you like on our expanded grill space.
