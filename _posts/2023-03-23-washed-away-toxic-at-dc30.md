For the first time in a long while, Toxic BBQ was interrupted by rain.  Thankfully, the skies waited to fall until 9PM, but that made our egress even more difficult than normal. With the help of many soaked hackers, we got the pavilion clean and clear, and everyone back to their hotels.

In a first, we did a pretty good job of collecting volunteer information! If we missed you, and you'd like to help organize next year, please reach out on the socials to get in on this.

Thanks for helping us make it happen, year after year.  Feels like home.
