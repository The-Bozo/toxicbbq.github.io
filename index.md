Join the humans of Vegas at the next inCARNEtion of your Thursday DEF CON welcome party.  Enjoy fewer walls and more garden as we meet AFK in the shade of Sunset Park. Burgers and dogs are provided; you bring everything else (specialties, drinks, labor, and donations). We're expanding our grills to over 40 sq ft of heat with space for veggies and your own personal creations.

## Events
In addition to the grill, Toxic is a gathering place for hackers looking to plan the rest of their weekend. Start your carnival off right with these side-shows:

- Peppercon: Push your spice tolerance to its breaking point. 
- Homebrew Exhibition: Bring your finest bitters, ciders, wine, and assorted preparations for a fermented face off.
- Weird Jerky: You can buy anything in Vegas, like dehydrated meat of questionable taste and origin. Spin the Wheel. Will it be ostrich, earthworm, or something even better?
- Open Grill: Bring your favorite and most exotic cuts, then grill it just how you like on our expanded grill space.
