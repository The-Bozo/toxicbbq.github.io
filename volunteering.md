Year after year: **You** make Toxic BBQ happen.

Toxic BBQ is an entirely volunteer-organized event run by hackers just like you. Our small team fronts the money for the venue, swag, and BBQ essentials. Buckets for donation on-site help cover the cost of food, equipment, security, and storage year after year.

But the cookout doesn't happen without hard work.  Here are ways you can contribute to the barbecue bodily. Each crew will leave with some swag and a renewed sense of community:

- **Supply Run**
    - Buying supplies helps stock the larder. After LineCon, meet under the giant screen at 1PM to join the collective Costco run.  You help pick and pay for the shopping, and we transport it to the park. Corporate crew fresh out of Black Hat?  Bring your per diem and feed 40 for the price of 4!

- **Setup**
    - Come on baby, light the fire. Meet under the big video wall at 1PM and head directly to the park. Set up misters, clean up tables, and light fires.

- **Grill**
    - Staffing the Grill makes the BBQ happen, literally. Grab your friends or come alone. We train on site and have all the tools. We keep you hydrated and flipping out for about an hour.

- **Exodus**
    - Keep us in the good graces of the Parks Department. Starting at 8:30PM, help clean up to get every hacker back to their lodgings safely. Leave the pavilion better than we found it.

There are even more ways to make Toxic BBQ the best. Over 800 people came to the park last year! Share your rental or taxi while making new BFFs. Answer the calls for M0aR!!1! Destiny calls, and it wants more ice. Or stop by the local grocery stores and being something to your liking. Here is a list of the most common items we need in bulk if you need inspiration:

- Ice (Block and Cubed)
- Bottled Water
- Drinks
- Sides
- Meat you grill up yourself
- Vegetarian food and meat alternatives

Do you have Mad Skillz? We are always looking to add special attractions to the BBQ. Bring your favorite dish, throw a keg of your homebrew into the car, jerry-rig a solar cooker, or set up a Ham Radio demonstration. Anything that keeps the conversation moving is appreciated. Contact us to coordinate if you have specific needs like power.

Still confused? Watch for flyers, the sign-bearer during LineCon, and keep a watch on social media for day-of announcements. Have a specific question? Ask! We won't bite unless you are first roasted on an open flame for 10-15 minutes and have reached an internal temp of at least 155F.
